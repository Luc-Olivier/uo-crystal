UPDATE July 8th, 2005
FIXED: NPCs so they are trammel friendly. Very special thanks to Greystar for his help on this issue.

I have had this for a long time and never released it. Sence i been seeing alot of quests on the boards i thought i would add one of mine.

This is a quest and grave digging system.

The quest is based on the built in RunUO v1.0.0 quest system. fully automated. The quest starts in magincia. and its a fun story to follow with some twists i have had it on my server now for over 8-9 months and players still love it.

Not to spoil the story line but.... And old man sends you on a quest for some medicne he needs. and you find yourself crossing the trammel map in search of the items the old man needs. At the end the man hands you a grave diggers shovel. (Please take the time to read the story line... didnt write it for my health lol )

Grave Digging
First and the quest outlines. You need mining. Higher your mining the more cool stuff you get. You need to go into a grave yard and start digging on a grave... Be sure to not to awake the undead lol... As you will, There are 42 grave items (Deco) 4 Artifacts, and a handfull of bones and miscs gems, scrolls, and magic loot to gather... Only one item per dig and your shovel is limited to a max of 20 uses. Does not mean you will get a max 20 they range from 5, 10, 15, 20 uses randomly per shovel. The quest will keep your players digging and busy for many hours to give you some rest... Trust me when i released it... i was not buged for events for at least a month LOL.

Setup
No distros to edit. Simply drop into your customs folder. then restart your server and say the ingame command. "[GenGDQ" this command will spawn all your quest NPCs needed for the quest in their correct locations, After uses the command goto Bucs Den (Trammel) and props Linda (Shes by the Inn) and set her BoyFriend to the NPC next to her named. "Remmy Crockett" Now if your forget to to do this no crash will happen but a key part of the quest diolog will be left out. The command is setup to do this for you however it does not always do it never checked into personaly cause its simple to do it by hand. After that Inform you players there is a new quest located in Magincia. (Look for Samus McNealson) and your all set.
