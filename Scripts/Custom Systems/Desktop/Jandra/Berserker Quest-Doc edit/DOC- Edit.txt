//Edit by Doc. Since skulls cannot stack. I used code from the ettin quest to make this more interesting.
When you talk to Ike, you will get an updated gump with a skull bucket. As you kill the berserkers, double
click the bucket.. the skull will delete and the bucket will gain weight. Once you have targeted 10 skulls
the bucket turns into a full buket of beserker skulls which you then drop on Ike to get Vengeance. - Doc
